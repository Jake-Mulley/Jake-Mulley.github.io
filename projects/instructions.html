            The right and left arrow keys are to move in different directions and the up arrow is to jump.
            The goal of this game is to find three keys to unveil the door and then enter the door. The score is generated using
            the time it took you to find the keys and exit through the door and also the amount of coins you collect.
            The more coins and the less time result in a higher score.
            You have one life so if you die the game will be reset and you will be place back at the start.
            The purple blobs are the enemys and when they hit you, you die.
